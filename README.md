# Lifeline-to-Wuhan
Covid-19 has brought huge impact to the world. It is the common responsibility of all countries to fight the epidemic together. Through visual and interactive web pages and taking emergency logistics as the clue, the work tells a touching story: in the spring of 2020, people all over China and even the world supported Wuhan to fight the epidemic and overcome the shortage of resources.
Wuhan, known as the "thoroughfare of nine provinces," has not been isolated from the outside world, but has received a steady stream of support despite the corona-virus crisis. The story is divided into four chapters. The color of the visualization page changes from dark to bright, representing Wuhan gradually getting rid of the haze of the epidemic. We hope to encourage people of all countries to work together and help each other in times of difficulty to defeat the Novel Corona-virus at an early date.
